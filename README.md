# ManHelp

ManHelp is a concept for an application to view the unix man pages without having to use
a terminal. The application presents a simple GUI that's equipped with buttons to sort
commands based on their category. In the future, the application could be extended to
use a search bar to narrow down results more easily.

## History

ManHelp was created for CS 3041 Human Computer Interaction at WPI during D term of 2016.

## Implementation

ManHelp is written in Java and uses JavaFX.

## Installation & Usage
You can launch the JAR file with the Java 8 Runtime Environment.
The JAR file is location in src/out/artifacts/ManHelp

If you have the JRE8 installed, you should be able to run this with 'java -jar src.jar' in a unix terminal.

Alternatively:
Import the project into your favorite Java environment.
Set up your run configurations to run an application with the main class set to Main in ControllerPackage.
Make sure you are running the application using Java 8, with lambda expressions enabled.
Run the program.

*Note that the root of the project is at the src folder level. Please import the project properly
so the relative paths line up correctly.

**Note that it is very important that you are running the program with the JRE8. This program utilizes lambdas
and will not work properly with an older version of Java.
